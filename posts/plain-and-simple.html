      <p>I've been thinking a lot about simplicity lately. The web has become increasingly complex, with frameworks upon frameworks, build tools upon build tools, and layers upon layers of abstraction. While these tools can be incredibly powerful and useful, they often come at the cost of simplicity and maintainability.</p>

      <p>What if we took a step back and asked ourselves: do we really need all this complexity? Could we achieve our goals with simpler solutions? Sometimes, plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all we need. Not everything needs to be a single-page application. Not every site needs real-time updates.</p>

      <p>This website is an experiment in simplicity. No frameworks, no build tools, just plain files served directly. And you know what? It works perfectly fine. It loads fast, it's easy to maintain, and it does exactly what it needs to do - no more, no less.</p>
