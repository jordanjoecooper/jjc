            Voting is the bedrock of democracy. It is how we choose our local and national leaders, make decisions that
            affect our all of lives and figure out how we move forward.

            But it has never been more suseptible to manipulation and abuse than it is today. In that I mean we have
            never been more susceptible to manipulation and abuse.

            <h2>Why?</h2>

            We are hyper-connected. We are hit with a flamethrower of information every way we look. An individual today
            consumes significantly more information in one day than the average person did even just 20 years ago.

            And it is not just quantity, it is quality. We are constantly being told what to think, what to feel, what
            to do. We are being manipulated on a scale never seen before.

            Couple this with the increase in AI, the further breakdown of the bonds that keep us together and you can
            see how easy it is to manipulate and control all of us should a group of powerful individuals decide they
            want to.

            <h2>What can we do?</h2>
            We can choose to try and get informed. We can decide to be skeptical. Seek out people with different views
            and listen
            to them, understand them and offer your own views in kind. Division, misinformation and manipulation are the
            tools used to confuse, and control. The only way to challenge them is to understand, converse and be open.
            And vote for whatever it is you believe in.
