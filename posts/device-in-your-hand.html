        Its more powerful than you think especially if you compare to what
        came before.
      </p>

        Smartphones are synonymous with modern life; we use them for
        communication, shopping, navigation, and much more. But what if I told
        you that the slab in your hand could easily, at least in terms of
        specifications, power an operation to put people on the moon?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's attempt to justify that seemingly ludicrous statement by looking
        back in history and comparing the average specifications of modern
        smartphones to the famed Apollo 11 guidance system used to put
        humanity on the moon, with some rough and ready comparisons: CPU:
        Central Processing Unit, Processes operations, this is the engine of
        your device. Ram: Random Access Memory, fast memory used to
        store/retrieve ()read/write) data, this is how your device does loads
        of things quickly.
      </p>
      <h4>Apollo 11 Guidance System</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>RAM: 32 Kilobytes (32,768 bits)</li>

        <li>CPU Speed: 0.043 MHz</li>

        <li>Weight: 70 lb (32 kg)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Average smartphones (2019)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>RAM: 6GB RAM (515,396,075,520 bits)</li>

        <li>CPU Speed: Usually Quad or Octa-core at 2.6 GHz</li>

        <li>Weight: Often around 0.330693 lb (0.15 kg or 150g)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The phone in your hand or pocket compared:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>RAM: 1.5 million times more memory</li>

        <li>CPU: 120,000+ times faster, at least</li>

        <li>Weight: 211 times lighter in pounds.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Amazing, right? Your average phone blows the Apollo 11 machine away by
        a ridiculous margin. However, we largely use our devices for less
        noble purposes than space travel—mostly arguments, selfies, memes, and
        cat videos. Imagine what we could do if humanity fully applied itself
        with our full available computational power.
