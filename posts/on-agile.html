        What happens when you use the word but dont walk the walk. Agile has
        grown in popularity and complexity, but what does it mean now?
      </p>
      <p>
        Most modern tech companies have embraced the Agile way of doing
        things. Many managers will try to propose Agile as the one and only
        solution to all problems. "Why isn't EVERYONE doing this? It's the
        best thing since sliced watermelon," said a manager from a large
        corporation somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agile introduces a forward and progressive way of developing not only
        software but also company procedures. It really can make a huge
        difference in how both management and employees function. Think of a
        company utilizing Agile everywhere like driving a car: You need to
        make continuous adjustments to navigate bends in the road. If you
        don't, you'll crash, brush the curb, or worse. This doesn't seem so
        bad, but if you keep hitting things, your car will slowly degrade and
        maybe even fail completely. Using Agile in a business is no different.
      </p>
      <p>
        No, I'm not advocating against it or promoting other methods. I am
        arguing against using it as though it is a fire-and-forget answer to
        all your prayers. There's a reason most powerful weapons have guidance
        systems... It is a great tool, and yes, it can definitely speed up
        development, collaboration, project management, and, more importantly,
        meeting deadlines when used correctly. BUT, it is a living,
        fire-breathing beast, and if you leave it alone without oversight,
        review, or adjustment long enough, it will escape its cage and wreak
        havoc.
