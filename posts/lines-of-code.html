        What does evaluating lines of code prove?
        As part of a significant restructuring at Twitter, Elon Musk brought
        in engineers he trusts from some of his other business interests,
        namely Tesla and SpaceX. These engineers reportedly decided to
        actively use the number of lines of code software engineers had
        written in the last three months as a measure of their employability.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is at worst painfully ignorant and at best a relic from
        1990s-style management thinking. Ok, if someone has written zero code
        for an extended period, it's worth investigating. Usually, they are
        either off sick or trying to solve problems elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, on a day-to-day basis, it can be a practically useless
        measure. For example, a poor software engineer could write 30 times
        the code of a good one. It's trivial to bulk out any solution and make
        it ten times or more in size while doing absolutely nothing better.
        This is one of the reasons it's a poor metric to use; it's a fence
        post with no planks. The approach taken was exposed when the same
        people who conducted the firings panicked upon realizing that they had
        let go of people they actually needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many ways to assess performance in software engineering, and
        simply relying on lines of code written is not one of them.
