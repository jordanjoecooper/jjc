      <p>How you can watch a classic movie written in ASCII from your own command line.
      </p>
      <p>I first stumbled across this when I was in Secondary School, back then I knew relatively little about
        coding/tech (I know slightly more now, but not much!).
        Back then I used Telnet on one of the schools fairly unrestricted windows boxes by running:
      </p>
      <code>telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl</code>
      <p>Both me & my friends at the time were amazed to see a film in ASCII on my machine (the Teachers were less than
        impressed).</p>
      <p>Fast forward a few more years than I would like to admit and it turns out it is still very much possible to see
        exactly what I watched back then the telnet method still works but I wanted a way to run it on Linux or Mac . .
        .

      </p>
      <p><strong>In the browser: </strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to: Telehack</li>
        <li>Type: starwars</li>
        <li>Hit enter</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <p>There is already a really good guide on doing this for Windows available <a
          href="https://www.wikihow.com/Watch-Star-Wars-on-Command-Prompt"></a>here.</p>
      <h3>Linux/Mac
      </h3>
      <p>Try this at your own risk, this is purely for educational purposes.
      <ol>
        <li> Open your terminal of choice
        </li>
        <li>Type: <code>nc towel.blinkenlights.nl 23</code></li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the curious among us I bet you are thinking “What is this command doing?” Well to be honest I didn't know
        either so I did a lazy dig and this is what I found out:

        NC is Netcat — "What the hell is that?"
      </p>
      <p><i>netcat (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network
          connections using TCP or UDP.</i></p>
      <p>There is a brief but good guide on using nc available <a
          href="https://www.mvps.net/docs/what-is-netcat-and-how-to-use-it/">here</a>And a rather interesting paper on
        how it can be useful and also misused available <a
          href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-1-59749-257-7.00005-4">here</a></p>
