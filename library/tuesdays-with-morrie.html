      <p>I recently received this book as a present. Fortunately over Christmas I had time to read. As such I had read the book within 48 hours. For the first time in as long as I can remember the book had me in tears. Some may find it crass and 'same old' but I found it a strong reminder of what is important.</p>

      <p>Given the book was written prior to our modern social media age I found it still amply made points that have gotten more relevant today, not less. Namely status is worthless, consumerism has its place but it is equally worthless when contrasted with the march of time. What is important is stories, love, loss and accepting all of these things without bitterness or resentment.</p>

      <p>How long will it be before you lose your sight, hearing or indeed your life? Were the afterlife to exist and you could float away from your body seeing all the people you love, or not see them depending on the circumstance... do you think you will give a shit about the shirt you wore, bank balance of your account or the car you drove? If your answer to this is yes, you have much to learn. I know I do.</p>
