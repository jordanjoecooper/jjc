      I first stumbled across Charlie Munger in a podcast called Founders made by the wonderfully voracious reader David Senra, it was a long time ago but if my memory is right he was talking about Warren Buffet and as I now know you don't do Warren without also finding Charlie and vice versa.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>At first I listened, then I dove in more, other podcasts, books on Warren and that all thanks to Warrens word on the matter led me to Charlie.</div><div><br></div><div>I could not afford the previous iteration of this book but when I heard there was a new addition from the Stripe Press I pre-ordered it was cheap compared to the original and frankly an absolute steal given its treasure like contents.</div><div><br></div><div>My notes on this book extend pretty far so this review is one I will add to in future. Unlike Charlie, I have much, much more to add.</div>
