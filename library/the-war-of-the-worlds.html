        Shamefully I had only watched movies and TV shows that imitated and attempted to bring to life the original book. Recently I purchased an eBook version of this and then prompts grabbed myself a collection of HG Wells books from the mid 1900s.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Writing is hard, writing about things that do not yet exist at a time when most of the modern amenities and luxuries we now enjoy either barely existed or were so rudimentary they were available to very few is astonishing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The author has a repetative ability to bring things to life that did not exist in his time but now are common and widely used, simply amazing.&nbsp;</div>
